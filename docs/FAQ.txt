Lemongrenade FAQ
-----------------

* How to run as a cluster?
  See dev/lauch_topologies.sh

* How do I run in local mode
  You can run in local mode without STORm for development and testing purposes.
  TODO:

* Where is the Lemongrenade UI
    http://localhost:9999/
    or
    /opt/lemongrenade/bin/lgtop.py

* Where is the Lemongrenade UI
    http://localhost:9999/
    or
    /opt/lemongrenade/bin/lgtop.py

* Do I need LEMONGRAPH?
   You can use INTERNAL processing mode, but it's really not recommended. (see props.conf file)
   LEMONGRAPH gives you all the magic,

* How do I start LEMONGRAPH?
  python -m LemonGraph.server -p 8001

* What is FINISHED_WITH_ERRORS?
  FINISHED_WITH_ERRORS means during graph processing, an adapter couldn't be reached or timeout. This mostly occurs
  because whatever upstream service your adapter is trying to contact was busy and just rejected your job. We are
  working to improve this process so that we can better detect TIMEOUTs VS. real Errros, but for now, we consider both
  to be errors. However, the reliability of storm will keep trying to process your job, and you will get data coming
  in to your graph even after FINISHED_WITH_ERRORs state has occurred. (Part of the process we will be improving in
  future release.)

* Why am I getting "Lemongraph doesn't know about graph" errors?
    1. Is lemongraph running, is it out of disk space, is there a permission problems?
    2. Do you have multiple lemongraphs running?
    3. Seriously, make sure you don't have muliple instances of LemonGraph running


Writing a new adapter
---------------------
1.
2.
3.
4. Set graph depth
   There are three ways a depth can be set
       1) adapter writers can set a depth for their adapter by overriding the getAdapterDepth() function
       2) job_config   depth=3   is a global setting for all adapters
       3) job_config   depth.adaptername=5  lets you set a different depth for an (or multiple) adapters

Storm
------
1. How do I remove all Storm data from Zookeeper  (Useful is you need to upgrade Storm)
    /bin/zkCli.sh
    ls
    rmr /storm

2. How do I access the storm UI
    http://localhost:8080

3.


Mongo
-------
*. How many ports does mongo have open?
   netstat -anp --tcp --udp | wc -l

   or from mongo commandline:
    db.serverStatus().connections

*. Why is mongo running out of ports at ~820?
    It seems there might be a startup bug with Mongo. it only allows 80% of ulimit. (80% of 1024 is 819.20)
    And even though we had our ulimit set much higher than 1024, it seems like it ignored it, to get around
    this, we started Mongo wth :
        /usr/bin/mongod --maxConns 10000

    You could probably go to 13000, but who is counting?
